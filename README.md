# Recognising-Objects
How computers recognise objects
Travel and Tourism:
  - This allows a computer to identify a certain place that you may want to go based on a certain category that you have placed into the search engine or image that has been passed throgh the system. 
  - There may be a problem with identifying where you want to go as there may be differnces in the categories or the computer may not identify the specific place that you may potentially be reffering to.
  - It may take into consideration things within an image which are irrelevant and dont need to be factored in which could skewer the results
Gaming and Entertainment:
  - This would allow a computer to identify a moving object which would be quite prevelant in a game and allow the user to interact with th eobject once they have come into view.
  - May not identify extremely small objects
Education and Learning:
  - It allows for students to access things more easily as the computer is able to identify what is required much faster and with less memory.
  - No delay in learning which allows for better retntion as well as learning speeds.
  - Misidentifcation can lead to misconceptions as well as gaps in knowledge
Transport and Navigation:
  - Allows for fast navigation as you are  able to quickly identify where to go as well as changes in location if a problem arises.
  - Prevents from people getting lost as the tarckign system is able to identify where it is
Medicine and Healthcare:
  - Able to identify specific cells which would allow for treatment like with cancer or different types of illnesses making it able to identify the problem faster
  - Can be used for malicious reasons and used to identify a problem or an illness within someone which could lead to extortion
  - Very restrited to how many types of cells that can be accessed so you cannot rely on it entirely.
